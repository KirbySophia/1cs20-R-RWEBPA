<h4>what is it..?</h4>
<center> <p> A computer needs something to power it. this device is responsible for supplying power  to the computer is the power supply.it converts the alternating voltage also knowm as AC to  electrical power system into continuous voltage also known as DC.in other words,it's converting conventional<strong> 110V</strong> or <strong>220V</strong> alternating voltage into continuous voltage used by the PC electronic components, which are<strong> +3.3 V, +5 V, +12 V </strong>and <strong>-12 V</strong>. The power supply also relates the temperature of the computer.</P> </center>

<ul>
    <li>110V is how much voltage comes through the wire.
       <li>220V a larger amount of of energy coming through the wire.
</ul>
<h4> if we didn't have it...?</h4>
<p>
    <center>if we didn't have a power supply in a computer it wouldn't work properly, overheating, not being able to charge and wouldn't last as long as if we did have it. </center>
</p>

<h4> Prices...</h4>
<p>
    <center>First, always buy a power supply from a reputable manufacturer, and look for reviews of it before you buy. Avoid cheap, generic power supplies, which tend to be substandard. Look for reputable brands that offer solid warranties and support. Corsair, Seasonic, and Antec are three manufacturers with reputations for producing high-quality power supplies, though even they may offer a few duds among all the studs. Do your homework!</center>
