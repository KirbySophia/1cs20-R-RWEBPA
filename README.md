  things i want to learn
  i want to learn how to add images to a thing because hey ever work for me. images are weird and hard to work with, without using the one that are given. if there is a way i can use images in a easier way, i would do it. images are something i would like to in every project.
i think that every page needs a images because it show everything you need to know and every part of what its looks like.

i also want to learn how to add more links to a things becasue it help guide the person.
links help people find there way around the set and without them they would lost, also wouldn't find the sources that we used.
i would like to use more link with finding diffenent section of page.
